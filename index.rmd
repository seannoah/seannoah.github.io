I am a postdoctoral researcher in [Michael Silver's lab](https://argentum.ucbso.berkeley.edu) and the [Berkeley Center for the Science of Psychedelics](https://bcsp.berkeley.edu) at UC Berkeley. 
<br>
<br>
In my research I investigate how the brain generates subjective experience using neuroimaging, psychophysical, psychopharmacological, and computational methods.
