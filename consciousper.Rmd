<h3>
Try finding the difference between these two pictures.
</h3>
<br>
Most people have trouble finding it right away. The two pictures seem identical, until your eyes eventually move to the right place, and then all of a sudden, the difference is obvious. How could we have been blind to it for so long?

The relationship of attention to conscious perception
</h2>
For those of us with unimpaired or corrected-to-normal vision, the visual world is a continuous whole. But this subjective sense that the visual field is complete and accurate, to the edges of where our eyes receive light, is an illusion. 
<br>
<br>
Many people know that our brains fill in gaps in our vision. Each of our eyes has a blind spot, a tiny void near the center of our eyesight about the size of a finger nail at arm's length, arising from the bald patch on our retinas where the optic nerve bundles together departing axons. The brain is able to slyly hide this blind spot from our subjective experience by filling it in with an approximation of the missing light and color. 
<br>
<br>
But most people don't realize that smoothing over missing visual information for the sake of perceptual continuity, like the way the brain handles the blind spot, is the norm, not the exception. Passively receiving the light falling onto our eyes is not sufficient for an accurate subjective picture of the world before us. In fact, it seems that the only way for the brain to construct an accurate visual picture is by using attention. Anywhere outside the focus of attention, and where attention is only deployed in trace amounts, our visual experience is just an approximation. In the example above, we perceived the two pictures as identical until our eyes (and with them, the focus of our attention) moved to the place where the change was happening. Notably, this effect can also be achieved with covert spatial attention, and you can try an example of that (fixate your eyes on the center of the image, and move your attention around the image without moving your eyes) [here](covert.html).

I'm interested in the relationship between attention and subjective, conscious perception. Ron Mangun and I wrote a [review paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331867465_Recent_evidence_that_attention_is_necessary_but_not_sufficient_for_conscious_perception) summarizing recent research around the two interrelated phenomena. We found that recent evidence supports the view that attention is necessary, but not sufficient, for conscious awareness.
